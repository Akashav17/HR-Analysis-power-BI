Processing: Using Excel, raw data was cleaned, and necessary transformations were applied. Data was organized into structured formats for better analysis, including handling missing values and removing duplicates.


Key Analysis and Visualizations:

1. Sales Trend Analysis: A line chart was created to observe monthly sales performance, identifying peaks during festive seasons or promotions.


2. Customer Segmentation: Using bar charts and pie charts, customers were segmented based on age, location, and buying frequency, identifying key customer demographics.


3. Product Performance:  were used to showcase top-performing product categories, highlighting items driving the highest revenue.


4. Sales by Region: A geographical map in Power BI depicted regional sales distribution, identifying areas with high and low sales density.


5. Customer Retention and Churn: Line and funnel charts tracked repeat purchases and customer churn rates, helping to devise strategies for improving customer loyalty.



Insights Derived:

Top Products: Certain categories (e.g., dairy, vegetables) consistently drive sales, while others may need promotional efforts.

Sales Patterns: Sales tend to peak during specific periods (e.g., weekends, festivals), suggesting timing for marketing campaigns.

Customer Retention: Regular customers are found primarily in metropolitan areas, while smaller towns show less engagement, pointing toward a need for targeted marketing.


Conclusion:
This project helped identify trends and performance metrics that could be leveraged to optimize the supply chain, enhance customer engagement, and improve sales strategies for the Blinkit grocery platform.
